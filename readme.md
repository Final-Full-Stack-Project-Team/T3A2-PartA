### Purpose:
The purpose of the app is to provide users with an effective and easy-to-use solution for sharing and collaborating on lists. Lists are used for many varying applications such as a grocery list, a to-do list, a travel itinerary a to-do list and more. This app aims to streamline the process of creating, sharing, and managing lists among multiple users with ease. It aims to have a clean UI and UX that makes sense without a steep learning curve so the user can efficiently use the list right away.

### Functionality / Features:

The app aims to have the following features. Although during development, things may change:

- User signup using bcrypt for passwords.

- User sign in page with password reset option.

- Once a user successfully signs up for an account they can create shared groups and add people to them via email. Groups are an optional feature which is useful for users who frequently share lists with the same people. A user can also invite people directly via email without the need to create a group.

- Users can create, read, update and delete new lists.

- Once a list is no longer needed it can be marked as completed.
There will be a "completed" section of the app where completed lists can be read, marked as active, or be deleted.

- All people with access to a list can add items and cross them off the list with a checkbox.

- Crossing items off the list adds a line through the text and ticks the checkbox for easy visual confirmation.

- User accounts, user groups, lists and list items are stored in individual MongoDB collections.

- Multiple users can collaborate on the same list simultaneously, adding items, crossing out completed tasks, and making real-time updates. This feature promotes teamwork and ensures everyone stays on the same page, literally.

### Target Audience:
The app's target audience is any individual or group of people who frequently need to create and manage shared lists. It caters to users of all ages and technical backgrounds, aiming to provide a user-friendly experience for both tech-savvy individuals and those less familiar with technology.

### Tech Stack:
The app utilizes a modern tech stack to deliver a seamless and responsive user experience:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Back-end: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Hosting: Netlify
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
